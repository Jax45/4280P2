Project 2

Description: This project's purpose is to create a parser
that will call the scanner and follow set BNF to create
a parse tree out of the tokens in a file. The program starts
by calling the parser from main.cpp which then calls the scanner
to get the first token. the parser then works with that token to
create a parse tree using the functions in tree.h which has a LL
of nodes from node.h. the parser continues to parse the code in the 
file until it either runs into an error in the sytnax
or finishs the parse tree and finds an EOF token.
the resulting tree is then traversed in a preorder fasion
to show the tokens in the most understandable way to the user.
with each node being traversed printed to screen with preceding
"__|" for each level of depth in the tree.

NOTE: generator.cpp, and generator.h are tests for P3 in the future
	and should not be graded with P2. they have been omitted from 
	the makefile and are not called anywhere except commented code.


--------HOW TO RUN-----------------
$ make clean
$ make
$ P2 [filename]

NOTE: the filename must have .SP2020 extension and the program
will add the extension on for you.
