I am using Option 3(FSA Table + driver)

Project 1

Description:
This project's purpose was to create a Scanner for the compiler we are building
incrementally. This scanner is meant to recognize a new language the
class has been given to compile. The Scanner is called from a driver function
in main.cpp for all tokens until it gets an EOF token. The Scanner
uses an FSA table that is within a class FSATable() inside of fsaTable.h.
The table contains states for the rows and columns for the character group.
Each character group is simplified using an Enum as well as the States.
When the scanner gets called the first thing that happens is comments,
whitespace, and tabs are removed. Then the first character is sent to the
fsaTable function GetState() with an initial state. the initial state plus the
character's group give us the row and column of the table which then gives us
the next state or the final token. the scanner then handles a bunch of exception
cases by manipulating the file.get() and file.unget() functions to take care of
error tokens and delimeter tokens with more than 1 character. 
--------HOW TO RUN-----------------
$ make clean
$ make
$ P1 [filename]

NOTE: the filename must have .SP2020 extension and the program
will add the extension on for you.
